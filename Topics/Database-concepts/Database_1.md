[//]: # (4. Different types of keys, super keys,candidate key)
[//]: # (. Super keys can be a single column or a set of multiple columns to uniquely identify a dataset)
[//]: # (. Minimum subset from super key set which can uniquley identify a dataset is called candidate key)
[//]: # (. Mimial single key which can uniquely identify a dataset is called primary key )

[//]: # (EXAMPLE)
[//]: # (SID SNAME SEMAIL SROLLNO SDESC)
[//]: # (PRIMARY KEY => SID)
[//]: # (SUPER KEYS => { SID + SNAME + SEMAIL + SROLLNO + SDESC } CAN BE ANY POSSIBLE COMBINATION )
